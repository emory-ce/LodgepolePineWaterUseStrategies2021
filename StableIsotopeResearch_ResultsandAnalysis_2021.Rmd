## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Read in Sources}
source ('WaterIso_2021.R')
source ('SoilMoisture_2021.R')
source('Met_2021.R')
source ('DBH_2021.R')
  summary(branch_iso)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
par (mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(2,2,2,2))
hist (soil_iso$HvSMOW, main = 'Soil HvSMOW')
hist (soil_iso$OvSMOW, main = 'Soil OvSMOW')
hist (branch_iso$HvSMOW, main = 'Branch HvSMOW')
hist (branch_iso$OvSMOW, main = 'Branch OvSMOW')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
